# Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (Educational)
This Python code provides a basic lung cancer risk assessment tool. It's important to understand that this is for educational purposes only and should not be used for medical diagnosis. If you are concerned about your health, please consult a doctor.

There will be some updates soon to make this program better for everyone using it and to make it more accurate. I hope that we can someday accurately predict and cure cancer to create a better future for everyone.

3. Create a venv in this folder.
4. Run `pip install requirements.txt` to install the necessary libraries.
5. Execute `python3 main.py` to run the application.
